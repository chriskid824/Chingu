# System Instructions for Chingu Project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Workflow Rules**:
> 1. **Modification Summary**: After every code modification or task completion, you MUST summarize the changes in **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)**.
> 2. **Verification**: Always **restart the test environment** (run `flutter run`) after applying changes to ensure the user can immediately test the updates. **You MUST verify that the restart command executed successfully and the app is running.**
> 3. **Testing Guide**: When asking the user to test, provide a clear list of **which screens** were modified and **how to navigate** to them.

# Project Context
